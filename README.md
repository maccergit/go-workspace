# 🚀 Exploring Golang: A Monorepo Workspace

This repository serves as a learning and exploration space for various concepts and idioms in the Go programming language (Golang).

The core application is a simple command-line greeting tool (`greetings/greetings.go`) used to demonstrate fundamental Go features.

## 🛠 Project Structure and Go Modules

This project uses a **Go Workspace**, which is a feature introduced in Go 1.18 to manage multiple modules within a single repository (a kind of monorepo).

| File/Directory | Purpose | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`go.work`** | **Workspace Definition** | Tells the Go toolchain to treat the listed directories as modules within this workspace. |
| **`greetings/`** | **Go Module** | Contains the first application module. |
| **`greetings/go.mod`** | **Module Dependency File** | Defines the module path (`maccergit/go-workspace/greetings`) and tracks external dependencies *for this specific module*. |
| **`greetings/greetings.go`** | **Executable Code** | Contains the `package main` executable and helper functions. |

## 🌟 Go Concepts Demonstrated in the Code

* **Exported Names:** Functions/variables starting with a capital letter (e.g., `ExtractNameFromArgs`) are public.
* **Multiple Return Values:** Functions commonly return `(value, error)`.
* **Idiomatic Error Handling:** Use of the `if value, err := function(); err != nil` pattern.
* **Early Exit Pattern:** Using `os.Exit(1)` to simplify control flow in `main` functions.

## 🏃 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project root: `cd go-workspace`
3.  Execute the main program using the Go toolchain:
    ```bash
    go run ./greetings <your-name>
    # Example: go run ./greetings John
    ```
